 * This class enforces two safety properties of the verification behavior:
 *
 * P1: Two verifications should never execute concurrently against the same environment.
 *
 *   For example, if the acme/tests:stable test container is currently running in the staging environment,
 *   keel should not launch any other verifications in the staging environment.
 *
 * P2:  Verifications against an environment should never happen concurrently with a deployment in an environment.
 *
 *   For example, if the fnord-v123.deb artifact is being deployed to an EC2 cluster in the staging environment,
 *   keel should not launch verifications while this is happening.
 *
 *
 * The enforcer works by granting the client a lease if the guard conditions are met.
 * A lease is a lock that has an expiration time. Leases expire to protect against the situation
 * where an instance takes a lease and then terminates unexpectedly before releasing it.
 *
 * If a client is unable to get a lease, the enforcer will throw a EnvironmentCurrentlyBeingActedOn exception.
